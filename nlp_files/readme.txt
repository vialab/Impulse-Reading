The files and scripts in this folder are used for NLP-based editing, for example to highlight content words in sentences.

These scripts use the NLTK library in Python.
Documentation for NLTK can be found here:
https://www.nltk.org/install.html

After installation, make sure to also follow the directions for installing NLTK Data; the scripts will fail without it.

Dependencies for this project were made using pipenv, following directions here:

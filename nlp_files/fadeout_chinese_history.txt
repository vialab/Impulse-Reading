<span class="highlight-one">(A) The Mongol Epoch (1280-1368)</span>
<span class="highlight-one">1	Beginning of new foreign rules During more than half of the third period of "Modern Times" which now began, China was under alien rule.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Of the 631 years from 1280 to 1911, China was under national rulers for 276 years and under alien rule for 355.</span> <span class="highlight-three">The alien rulers were first the Mongols, and later the Tungus Manchus.</span> <span class="highlight-four">It is interesting to note that the alien rulers in the earlier period came mainly from the north-west, and only in modern times did peoples from the north-east rule over China.</span> <span class="highlight-five">This was due in part to the fact that only peoples who had attained a certain level of civilization were capable of dominance.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In antiquity and the Middle Ages, eastern Mongolia and Manchuria were at a relatively low level of civilization, from which they emerged only gradually through permanent contact with other nomad peoples, especially Turks.</span> <span class="highlight-five">We are dealing here, of course, only with the Mongol epoch in China and not with the great Mongol empire, so that we need not enter further into these questions.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">Yet another point is characteristic: the Mongols were the first alien people to rule the whole of China; the Manchus, who appeared in the seventeenth century, were the second and last.</span> <span class="highlight-two">All alien peoples before these two ruled only parts of China.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Why was it that the Mongols were able to be so much more successful than their predecessors?</span> <span class="highlight-four">In the first place the Mongol political league was numerically stronger than those of the earlier alien peoples; secondly, the military organization and technical equipment of the Mongols were exceptionally advanced for their day.</span> <span class="highlight-five">It must be borne in mind, for instance, that during their many years of war against the Sung dynasty in South China the Mongols already made use of small cannon in laying siege to towns.</span> <span class="highlight-five">We have no exact knowledge of the number of Mongols who invaded and occupied China, but it is estimated that there were more than a million Mongols living in China.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Not all of them, of course, were really Mongols!</span> <span class="highlight-five">The name covered Turks, Tunguses, and others; among the auxiliaries of the Mongols were Uighurs, men from Central Asia and the Middle East, and even Europeans.</span> <span class="highlight-five">When the Mongols attacked China they had the advantage of all the arts and crafts and all the new technical advances of western and central Asia and of Europe.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Thus they had attained a high degree of technical progress, and at the same time their number was very great.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">2	"_Nationality legislation_"</span>
<span class="highlight-one">It was only after the Hsia empire in North China, and then the empire of the JuchÃªn, had been destroyed by the Mongols, and only after long and remarkably modern tactical preparation, that the Mongols conquered South China, the empire of the Sung dynasty.</span> <span class="highlight-two">They were now faced with the problem of ruling their great new empire.</span> <span class="highlight-three">The conqueror of that empire, Kublai, himself recognized that China could not be treated in quite the same way as the Mongols' previous conquests; he therefore separated the empire in China from the rest of the Mongol empire.</span> <span class="highlight-four">Mongol China became an independent realm within the Mongol empire, a sort of Dominion.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The Mongol rulers were well aware that in spite of their numerical strength they were still only a minority in China, and this implied certain dangers.</span> <span class="highlight-five">They therefore elaborated a "nationality legislation", the first of its kind in the Far East.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The purpose of this legislation was, of course, to be the protection of the Mongols.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The population of conquered China was divided into four groups--(1) Mongols, themselves falling into four sub-groups (the oldest Mongol tribes, the White Tatars, the Black Tatars, the Wild Tatars); (2) Central Asian auxiliaries (Naimans, Uighurs, and various other Turkish people, Tanguts, and so on); (3) North Chinese; (4) South Chinese.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The Mongols formed the privileged ruling class.</span> <span class="highlight-five">They remained militarily organized, and were distributed in garrisons over all the big towns of China as soldiers, maintained by the state.</span> <span class="highlight-five">All the higher government posts were reserved for them, so that they also formed the heads of the official staffs.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The auxiliary peoples were also admitted into the government service; they, too, had privileges, but were not all soldiers but in many cases merchants, who used their privileged position to promote business.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Not a few of these merchants were Uighurs and Mohammedans; many Uighurs were also employed as clerks, as the Mongols were very often unable to read and write Chinese, and the government offices were bilingual, working in Mongolian and Chinese.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The clever Uighurs quickly learned enough of both languages for official purposes, and made themselves indispensable assistants to the Mongols.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Persian, the main language of administration in the western parts of the Mongol empire besides Uighuric, also was a lingua franca among the new rulers of China.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">In the Mongol legislation the South Chinese had the lowest status, and virtually no rights.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Intermarriage with them was prohibited.</span> <span class="highlight-three">The Chinese were not allowed to carry arms.</span> <span class="highlight-four">For a time they were forbidden even to learn the Mongol or other foreign languages.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In this way they were to be prevented from gaining official positions and playing any political part.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Their ignorance of the languages of northern, central, and western Asia also prevented them from engaging in commerce like the foreign merchants, and every possible difficulty was put in the way of their travelling for commercial purposes.</span> <span class="highlight-five">On the other hand, foreigners were, of course, able to learn Chinese, and so to gain a footing in Chinese internal trade.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">Through legislation of this type the Mongols tried to build up and to safeguard their domination over China.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Yet their success did not last a hundred years.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">3	Military position In foreign affairs the Mongol epoch was for China something of a breathing space, for the great wars of the Mongols took place at a remote distance from China and without any Chinese participation.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Only a few concluding wars were fought under Kublai in the Far East.</span> <span class="highlight-three">The first was his war against Japan (1281): it ended in complete failure, the fleet being destroyed by a storm.</span> <span class="highlight-four">In this campaign the Chinese furnished ships and also soldiers.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The subjection of Japan would have been in the interest of the Chinese, as it would have opened a market which had been almost closed against them in the Sung period.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Mongol wars followed in the south.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In 1282 began the war against Burma; in 1284 Annam and Cambodia were conquered; in 1292 a campaign was started against Java.</span> <span class="highlight-five">It proved impossible to hold Java, but almost the whole of Indo-China came under Mongol rule, to the satisfaction of the Chinese, for Indo-China had already been one of the principal export markets in the Sung period.</span> <span class="highlight-five">After that, however, there was virtually no more warfare, apart from small campaigns against rebellious tribes.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The Mongol soldiers now lived on their pay in their garrisons, with nothing to do.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The old campaigners died and were followed by their sons, brought up also as soldiers; but these young Mongols were born in China, had seen nothing of war, and learned of the soldiers' trade either nothing or very little; so that after about 1320 serious things happened.</span> <span class="highlight-five">An army nominally 1,000 strong was sent against a group of barely fifty bandits and failed to defeat them.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Most of the 1,000 soldiers no longer knew how to use their weapons, and many did not even join the force.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Such incidents occurred again and again.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">4	Social situation The results, however, of conditions within the country were of much more importance than events abroad.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The Mongols made Peking their capital as was entirely natural, for Peking was near their homeland Mongolia.</span> <span class="highlight-three">The emperor and his entourage could return to Mongolia in the summer, when China became too hot or too humid for them; and from Peking they were able to maintain contact with the rest of the Mongol empire.</span> <span class="highlight-four">But as the city had become the capital of a vast empire, an enormous staff of officials had to be housed there, consisting of persons of many different nationalities.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The emperor naturally wanted to have a magnificent capital, a city really worthy of so vast an empire.</span> <span class="highlight-five">As the many wars had brought in vast booty, there was money for the building of great palaces, of a size and magnificence never before seen in China.</span> <span class="highlight-five">They were built by Chinese forced labour, and to this end men had to be brought from all over the empire--poor peasants, whose fields went out of cultivation while they were held in bondage far away.</span> <span class="highlight-five">If they ever returned home, they were destitute and had lost their land.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The rich gentry, on the other hand, were able to buy immunity from forced labour.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The immense increase in the population of Peking (the huge court with its enormous expenditure, the mass of officials, the great merchant community, largely foreigners, and the many servile labourers), necessitated vast supplies of food.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Now, as mentioned in earlier chapters, since the time of the Later T'ang the region round Nanking had become the main centre of production in China, and the Chinese population had gone over more and more to the consumption of rice instead of pulse or wheat.</span> <span class="highlight-five">As rice could not be grown in the north, practically the whole of the food supplies for the capital had to be brought from the south.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The transport system taken over by the Mongols had not been created for long-distance traffic of this sort.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The capital of the Sung had lain in the main centre of production.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Consequently, a great fleet had suddenly to be built, canals and rivers had to be regulated, and some new canals excavated.</span> <span class="highlight-five">This again called for a vast quantity of forced labour, often brought from afar to the points at which it was needed.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The Chinese peasants had suffered in the Sung period.</span> <span class="highlight-five">They had been exploited by the large landowners.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The Mongols had not removed these landowners, as the Chinese gentry had gone over to their side.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The Mongols had deprived them of their political power, but had left them their estates, the basis of their power.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In past changes of dynasty the gentry had either maintained their position or been replaced by a new gentry: the total number of their class had remained virtually unchanged.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Now, however, in addition to the original gentry there were about a million Mongols, for whose maintenance the peasants had also to provide, and their standard of maintenance was high.</span> <span class="highlight-five">This was an enormous increase in the burdens of the peasantry.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">Two other elements further pressed on the peasants in the Mongol epoch--organized religion and the traders.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The upper classes among the Chinese had in general little interest in religion, but the Mongols, owing to their historical development, were very religious.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Some of them and some of their allies were Buddhists, some were still shamanists.</span> <span class="highlight-four">The Chinese Buddhists and the representatives of popular Taoism approached the</span>
<span class="highlight-one">Mongols and the foreign Buddhist monks trying to enlist the interest of the Mongols and their allies.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The old shamanism was unable to compete with the higher religions, and the Mongols in China became Buddhist or interested themselves in popular Taoism.</span> <span class="highlight-three">They showed their interest especially by the endowment of temples and monasteries.</span> <span class="highlight-four">The temples were given great estates, and the peasants on those estates became temple servants.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The land belonging to the temples was free from taxation.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">We have as yet no exact statistics of the Mongol epoch, only approximations.</span> <span class="highlight-two">These set the total area under cultivation at some six million _ch'ing_ (a _ch'ing_ is the ideal size of the farm worked by a peasant family, but it was rarely held in practice); the population amounted to fourteen or fifteen million families.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Of this total tillage some 170,000 _ch'ing_ were allotted to the temples; that is to say, the farms for some 400,000 peasant families were taken from the peasants and no longer paid taxes to the state.</span> <span class="highlight-four">The peasants, however, had to make payments to the temples.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Some 200,000 _ch'ing_ with some 450,000 peasant families were turned into military settlements; that is to say, these peasants had to work for the needs of the army.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Their taxes went not to the state but to the army.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Moreover, in the event of war they had to render service to the army.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In addition to this, all higher officials received official properties, the yield of which represented part payment of their salaries.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Then, Mongol nobles and dignitaries received considerable grants of land, which was taken away from the free peasants; the peasants had then to work their farms as tenants and to pay dues to their landlords, no longer to the state.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Finally, especially in North China, many peasants were entirely dispossessed, and their land was turned into pasturage for the Mongols' horses; the peasants themselves were put to forced labour.</span> <span class="highlight-five">On top of this came the exploitation of the peasants by the great landowners of the past.</span> <span class="highlight-five">All this meant an enormous diminution in the number of free peasants and thus of taxpayers.</span> <span class="highlight-five">As the state was involved in more expenditure than in the past owing to the large number of Mongols who were its virtual pensioners, the taxes had to be continually increased.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Meanwhile the many peasants working as tenants of the great landlords, the temples, and the Mongol nobles were entirely at their mercy.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In this period, a second migration of farmers into the southern provinces, mainly Fukien and Kwangtung, took place; it had its main source in the lower Yangtze valley.</span> <span class="highlight-five">A few gentry families whose relatives had accompanied the Sung emperor on their flight to the south, also settled with their followers in the Canton basin.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">The many merchants from abroad, especially those belonging to the peoples allied to the Mongols, also had in every respect a privileged position in China.</span> <span class="highlight-two">They were free of taxation, free to travel all over the country, and received privileged treatment in the use of means of transport.</span> <span class="highlight-three">They were thus able to accumulate great wealth, most of which went out of China to their own country.</span> <span class="highlight-four">This produced a general impoverishment of China.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Chinese merchants fell more and more into dependence on the foreign merchants; the only field of action really remaining to them was the local trade within China and the trade with Indo-China, where the Chinese had the advantage of knowing the language.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">The impoverishment of China began with the flow abroad of her metallic currency.</span> <span class="highlight-two">To make up for this loss, the government was compelled to issue great quantities of paper money, which very quickly depreciated, because after a few years the government would no longer accept the money at its</span>
<span class="highlight-one">face value, so that the population could place no faith in it.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The depreciation further impoverished the people.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">Thus we have in the Mongol epoch in China the imposing picture of a commerce made possible with every country from Europe to the Pacific; this, however, led to the impoverishment of China.</span> <span class="highlight-two">We also see the rising of mighty temples and monumental buildings, but this again only contributed to the denudation of the country.</span> <span class="highlight-three">The Mongol epoch was thus one of continual and rapid impoverishment in China, simultaneously with a great display of magnificence.</span> <span class="highlight-four">The enthusiastic descriptions of the Mongol empire in China offered by travellers from the Near East or from Europe, such as Marco Polo, give an entirely false picture: as foreigners they had a privileged position, living in the cities and seeing nothing of the situation of the general population.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">5 _Popular risings: National rising_</span>
<span class="highlight-one">It took time for the effects of all these factors to become evident.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The first popular rising came in 1325.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Statistics of 1329 show that there were then some 7,600,000 persons in the empire who were starving; as this was only the figure of the officially admitted sufferers, the figure may have been higher.</span> <span class="highlight-four">In any case, seven-and-a-half millions were a substantial percentage of the total population, estimated at 45,000,000.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The risings that now came incessantly were led by men of the lower orders--a cloth-seller, a fisherman, a peasant, a salt smuggler, the son of a soldier serving a sentence, an office messenger, and so on.</span> <span class="highlight-five">They never attacked the Mongols as aliens, but always the rich in general, whether Chinese or foreign.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Wherever they came, they killed all the rich and distributed their money and possessions.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">As already mentioned, the Mongol garrisons were unable to cope with these risings.</span> <span class="highlight-two">But how was it that the Mongol rule did not collapse until some forty years later?</span> <span class="highlight-three">The Mongols parried the risings by raising loans from the rich and using the money to recruit volunteers to fight the rebels.</span> <span class="highlight-four">The state revenues would not have sufficed for these payments, and the item was not one that could be included in the military budget.</span> <span class="highlight-five">What was of much more importance was that the gentry themselves recruited volunteers and fought the rebels on their own account, without the authority or the support of the government.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Thus it was the Chinese gentry, in their fear of being killed by the insurgents, who fought them and so bolstered up the Mongol rule.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">In 1351 the dykes along the Yellow River burst.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The dykes had to be reconstructed and further measures of conservancy undertaken.</span> <span class="highlight-three">To this end the government impressed 170,000 men.</span> <span class="highlight-four">Following this action, great new revolts broke out.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Everywhere in Honan, Kiangsu, and Shantung, the regions from which the labourers were summoned, revolutionary groups were formed, some of them amounting to 100,000 men.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Some groups had a religious tinge; others declared their intention to restore the emperors of the Sung dynasty.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Before long great parts of central China were wrested from the hands of the government.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The government recognized the menace to its existence, but resorted to contradictory measures.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In 1352 southern Chinese were permitted to take over certain official positions.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In this way it was hoped to gain the full support of the gentry, who had a certain interest in combating the rebel movements.</span> <span class="highlight-five">On the other hand, the government tightened up its nationality laws.</span> <span class="highlight-five">All the old segregation laws were brought back into force, with the result that in a few years the aim of the rebels became no longer merely the expulsion of the rich but also the expulsion of the Mongols: a social movement thus became a national one.</span> <span class="highlight-five">A second element contributed to the change in the character of the popular rising.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The rebels captured many towns.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Some of these towns refused to fight and negotiated terms of submission.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In these cases the rebels did not murder the whole of the gentry, but took some of them into their service.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The gentry did not agree to this out of sympathy with the rebels, but simply in order to save their own lives.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Once they had taken the step, however, they could not go back; they had no alternative but to remain on the side of the rebels.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">In 1352 Kuo Tz[)u]-hsing rose in southern Honan.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Kuo was the son of a wandering soothsayer and a blind beggar-woman.</span> <span class="highlight-three">He had success; his group gained control of a considerable region round his home.</span> <span class="highlight-four">There was no longer any serious resistance from the Mongols, for at this time the whole of eastern China was in full revolt.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In 1353 Kuo was joined by a man named Chu YÃ¼an-chang, the son of a small peasant, probably a tenant farmer.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Chu's parents and all his relatives had died from a plague, leaving him destitute.</span> <span class="highlight-five">He had first entered a monastery and become a monk.</span> <span class="highlight-five">This was a favourite resource--and has been almost to the present day--for poor sons of peasants who were threatened with starvation.</span> <span class="highlight-five">As a monk he had gone about begging, until in 1353 he returned to his home and collected a group, mostly men from his own village, sons of peasants and young fellows who had already been peasant leaders.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Monks were often peasant leaders.</span> <span class="highlight-five">They were trusted because they promised divine aid, and because they were usually rather better educated than the rest of the peasants.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Chu at first also had contacts with a secret society, a branch of the White Lotus Society which several times in the course of Chinese history has been the nucleus of rebellious movements.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Chu took his small group which identified itself by a red turban and a red banner to Kuo, who received him gladly, entered into alliance with him, and in sign of friendship gave him his daughter in marriage.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In 1355 Kuo died, and Chu took over his army, now many thousands strong.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In his campaigns against towns in eastern China, Chu succeeded in winning over some capable members of the gentry.</span> <span class="highlight-five">One was the chairman of a committee that yielded a town to Chu; another was a scholar whose family had always been opposed to the Mongols, and who had himself suffered injustice several times in his official career, so that he was glad to join Chu out of hatred of the Mongols.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">These men gained great influence over Chu, and persuaded him to give up attacking rich individuals, and instead to establish an assured control over large parts of the country.</span> <span class="highlight-two">He would then, they pointed out, be permanently enriched, while otherwise he would only be in funds at the moment of the plundering of a town.</span> <span class="highlight-three">They set before him strategic plans with that aim.</span> <span class="highlight-four">Through their counsel Chu changed from the leader of a popular rising into a fighter against the dynasty.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Of all the peasant leaders he was now the only one pursuing a definite aim.</span> <span class="highlight-five">He marched first against Nanking, the great city of central China, and captured it with ease.</span> <span class="highlight-five">He then crossed the Yangtze, and conquered the rich provinces of the south-east.</span> <span class="highlight-five">He was a rebel who no longer slaughtered the rich or plundered the towns, and the whole of the gentry with all their followers came over to him en masse.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The armies of volunteers went over to Chu, and the whole edifice of the dynasty collapsed.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">The years 1355-1368 were full of small battles.</span> <span class="highlight-two">After his conquest of the whole of the south, Chu went north.</span> <span class="highlight-three">In 1368 his generals captured Peking almost without a blow.</span> <span class="highlight-four">The Mongol ruler fled on horseback with his immediate entourage into the north of China, and soon after into Mongolia.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The Mongol dynasty had been brought down, almost without resistance.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The Mongols in the isolated garrisons marched northward wherever they could.</span> <span class="highlight-five">A few surrendered to the Chinese and were used in southern China as professional soldiers, though they were always regarded with suspicion.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The only serious resistance offered came from the regions in which other Chinese popular leaders had established themselves, especially the remote provinces in the west and south-west, which had a different social structure and had been relatively little affected by the Mongol regime.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">Thus the collapse of the Mongols came for the following reasons: (1) They had not succeeded in maintaining their armed strength or that of their allies during the period of peace that followed Kublai's conquest.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The Mongol soldiers had become effeminate through their life of idleness in the towns.</span> <span class="highlight-three">(2) The attempt to rule the empire through Mongols or other aliens, and to exclude the Chinese gentry entirely from the administration, failed through insufficient knowledge of the sources of revenue and through the abuses due to the favoured treatment of aliens.</span> <span class="highlight-four">The whole country, and especially the peasantry, was completely impoverished and so driven into revolt.</span> <span class="highlight-five">(3) There was also a psychological reason.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In the middle of the fourteenth century it was obvious to the Mongols that their hold over China was growing more and more precarious, and that there was little to be got out of the impoverished country: they seem in consequence to have lost interest in the troublesome task of maintaining their rule, preferring, in so far as they had not already entirely degenerated, to return to their old home in the north.</span> <span class="highlight-five">It is important to bear in mind these reasons for the collapse of the Mongols, so that we may compare them later with the reasons for the collapse of the Manchus.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">No mention need be made here of the names of the Mongol rulers in China after Kublai.</span> <span class="highlight-two">After his death in 1294, grandsons and great-grandsons of his followed each other in rapid succession on the throne; not one of them was of any personal significance.</span> <span class="highlight-three">They had no influence on the government of China.</span> <span class="highlight-four">Their life was spent in intriguing against one another.</span> <span class="highlight-five">There were seven Mongol emperors after Kublai.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">6 Cultural During the Mongol epoch a large number of the Chinese scholars withdrew from official life.</span> <span class="highlight-two">They lived in retirement among their friends, and devoted themselves mainly to the pursuit of the art of poetry, which had been elaborated in the Later Sung epoch, without themselves arriving at any important innovations in form.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Their poems were built up meticulously on the rules laid down by the various schools; they were routine productions rather than the outcome of any true poetic inspiration.</span> <span class="highlight-four">In the realm of prose the best achievements were the "miscellaneous notes" already mentioned, collections of learned essays.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The foreigners who wrote in Chinese during this epoch are credited with no better achievements by the Chinese historians of literature.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Chief of them were a statesman named Yeh-lÃ¼ Ch'u-ts'ai, a Kitan in the service of the Mongols; and a Mongol named T'o-t'o (Tokto).</span> <span class="highlight-five">The former accompanied Genghiz Khan in his great campaign against Turkestan, and left a very interesting account of his journeys, together with many poems about Samarkand and Turkestan.</span> <span class="highlight-five">His other works were mainly letters and poems addressed to friends.</span> <span class="highlight-five">They differ in no way in style from the Chinese literary works of the time, and are neither better nor worse than those works.</span> <span class="highlight-five">He shows strong traces of Taoist influence, as do other contemporary writers.</span> <span class="highlight-five">We know that Genghiz Khan was more or less inclined to Taoism, and admitted a Taoist monk to his camp (1221-1224).</span> <span class="highlight-five">This man's account of his travels has also been preserved, and with the numerous European accounts of Central Asia written at this time it forms an important source.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The Mongol Tokto was the head of an historical commission that issued the annals of the Sung dynasty, the Kitan, and the JuchÃªn dynasty.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The annals of the Sung dynasty became the largest of all the historical works, but they were fiercely attacked from the first by Chinese critics on account of their style and their hasty composition, and, together with the annals of the Mongol dynasty, they are regarded as the worst of the annals preserved.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Tokto himself is less to blame for this than the circumstance that he was compelled to work in great haste, and had not time to put into order the overwhelming mass of his material.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">The greatest literary achievements, however, of the Mongol period belong beyond question to the theatre (or, rather, opera).</span> <span class="highlight-two">The emperors were great theatre-goers, and the wealthy private families were also enthusiasts, so that gradually people of education devoted themselves to writing librettos for the operas, where in the past this work had been left to others.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Most of the authors of these librettos remained unknown: they used pseudonyms, partly because playwriting was not an occupation that befitted a scholar, and partly because in these works they criticized the conditions of their day.</span> <span class="highlight-four">These works are divided in regard to style into two groups, those of the "southern" and the "northern" drama; these are distinguished from each other in musical construction and in their intellectual attitude: in general the northern works are more heroic and the southern more sentimental, though there are exceptions.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The most famous northern works of the Mongol epoch are _P'i-p'a-chi_ ("The Story of a Lute"), written about 1356, probably by Kao Ming, and _Chao-shih ku-erh-chi_ ("The Story of the Orphan of Chao "), a work that enthralled Voltaire, who made a paraphrase of it; its author was the otherwise unknown Chi ChÃ¼n-hsiang.</span> <span class="highlight-five">One of the most famous of the southern dramas is _Hsi-hsiang-chi_ ("The Romance of the Western Chamber"), by Wang Shih-fu and Kuan Han-ch'ing.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Kuan lived under the JuchÃªn dynasty as a physician, and then among the Mongols.</span> <span class="highlight-five">He is said to have written fifty-eight dramas, many of which became famous.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">In the fine arts, foreign influence made itself felt during the Mongol epoch much more than in literature.</span> <span class="highlight-two">This was due in part to the Mongol rulers' predilection for the Lamaism that was widespread in their homeland.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Lamaism is a special form of Buddhism which developed in Tibet, where remnants of the old national Tibetan cult (_Bon_) were fused with Buddhism into a distinctive religion.</span> <span class="highlight-four">During the rise of the Mongols this religion, which closely resembled the shamanism of the ancient Mongols, spread in Mongolia, and through the Mongols it made great progress in China, where it had been insignificant until their time.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Religious sculpture especially came entirely under Tibetan influence (particularly that of the sculptor Aniko, who came from Nepal, where he was born in 1244).</span> <span class="highlight-five">This influence was noticeable in the Chinese sculptor Liu YÃ¼an; after him it became stronger and stronger, lasting until the Manchu epoch.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">In architecture, too, Indian and Tibetan influence was felt in this period.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The Tibetan pagodas came into special prominence alongside the previously known form of pagoda, which has many storeys, growing smaller as they go upward; these towers originally contained relics of Buddha and his disciples.</span> <span class="highlight-three">The Tibetan pagoda has not this division into storeys, and its lower part is much larger in circumference, and often round.</span> <span class="highlight-four">To this day Peking is rich in pagodas in the Tibetan style.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">The Mongols also developed in China the art of carpet-knotting, which to this day is found only in North China in the zone of northern influence.</span> <span class="highlight-two">There were carpets before these, but they were mainly of felt.</span> <span class="highlight-three">The knotted carpets were produced in imperial workshops--only, of course, for the Mongols, who were used to carpets.</span> <span class="highlight-four">A further development probably also due to West Asian influence was that of cloisonnÃ© technique in China in this period.</span>
<span class="highlight-one">Painting, on the other hand, remained free from alien influence, with the exception of the craft painting for the temples.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The most famous painters of the Mongol epoch were Chao MÃªng-fu (also called Chao Chung-mu, 1254-1322), a relative of the deposed imperial family of the Sung dynasty, and Ni Tsan (1301-1374).</span>

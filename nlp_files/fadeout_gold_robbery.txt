<span class="highlight-one">The Great Gold Robbery took place on the night of 15 May 1855, when a routine shipment of three boxes of gold bullion and coins was stolen from the guard's van of the service between London Bridge station and Folkestone while it was being shipped to Paris.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The robbers comprised four men, two of whom—William Tester and James Burgess—were employees of the South Eastern Railway (SER), the company that ran the rail service.</span> <span class="highlight-three">They were joined by the planners of the crime: Edward Agar, a career criminal, and William Pierce, a former employee of the SER who had been dismissed for being a gambler.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">During transit, the gold was held in "railway safes", which needed two keys to open.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The men took wax impressions of the keys and made their own copies.</span> <span class="highlight-three">When they knew a shipment was taking place, Tester ensured Burgess was on guard duty, and Agar hid in the guard's van.</span> <span class="highlight-four">They emptied the safes of 224 pounds (102 kg) of gold, valued at the time at £12,000 (approximately equivalent to £1,193,000 in 2021), then left the train at Dover.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The police and railway authorities had no clues as to who had undertaken the theft, and arguments ensued as to whether it had been stolen in England, on the ship crossing the English Channel, or on the French leg of the journey.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">When Agar was arrested for another crime, he asked Pierce to provide Fanny Kay—his former girlfriend—and child with funds.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Pierce agreed and then reneged.</span> <span class="highlight-three">In need of money, Kay went to the governor of Newgate Prison and told him who had undertaken the theft.</span> <span class="highlight-four">Agar was questioned, admitted his guilt and testified as a witness.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Pierce, Tester and Burgess were all arrested, tried and found guilty of the theft.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Pierce received a sentence of two years' hard labour in England; Tester and Burgess were sentenced to penal transportation for 14 years.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">The crime was the subject of a television play in 1960, with Colin Blakely as Pierce.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The Great Train Robbery, a novel by the writer and director Michael Crichton, was published in 1975.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Crichton adapted his work into a feature film, The First Great Train Robbery, with Sean Connery portraying Pierce.</span>

<span class="highlight-one"><h2>Background</h2></span>

<span class="highlight-one"><h3>South Eastern Railway</h3></span>

<span class="highlight-one">In 1855 the South Eastern Railway (SER) ran a boat train service between London Bridge station and Folkestone, on the south coast of England.</span> <span class="highlight-two">It provided part of the main route to Paris at the time, with a railway steamer from Folkestone to Boulogne-sur-Mer, northern France, and a train to complete the journey direct to Paris.</span> <span class="highlight-three">The service ran at 8:00 am, 11:30 am and 4:30 pm; there was also an overnight mail service that left at 8:30 pm and a tidal ferry service.</span> <span class="highlight-four">Periodically the line would carry shipments of gold from bullion merchants in London to their counterparts in Paris; these could be several hundredweights at a time.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The bullion would be packed into wooden boxes, bound with iron hoops and with a wax seal bearing the coat of arms of the bullion dealers in question: Abell & Co, Adam Spielmann & Co and Messrs Bult & Co.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The agents who arranged the carriage of the gold, including collecting the bullion from the three companies and delivering it to London Bridge, were Chaplin & Co.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The gold shipments always went on the 8:30 pm train.</span> <span class="highlight-five">At Boulogne the bullion boxes were collected by the French agents Messageries impériales before being transported by train to the Gare du Nord and then to the Bank of France.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">As a security measure, the boxes were weighed when they were loaded onto the guard's van, at Folkestone, on arrival at Boulogne and then again on arrival in Paris.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The company's guard's vans were fitted with three patented "railway safes" provided by Chubb & Son.</span> <span class="highlight-three">These were three-feet (0.91 m) square and made of inch-thick (2.5 cm) steel.</span> <span class="highlight-four">Access to the safe was through its lid, which was hinged for access; the exterior had two keyholes, high on the front.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Each of the three safes had the same pair of locks, meaning that only two keys were needed to open all three safes.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Copies of the keys were held separately by SER officials at London Bridge and Folkestone, and the company ensured no individual could hold both keys at the same time.</span>

<span class="highlight-one"><h3>Participants</h3></span>

<span class="highlight-one">The originator of the plan was William Pierce, a 37-year-old former employee of the SER who had been dismissed from its service after it was found that he was a gambler; he worked as a ticket printer in a betting shop after leaving the company.</span> <span class="highlight-two">According to the historian Donald Thomas, Pierce was "a large-faced and rather clumsy man with a taste for loud waistcoats and fancy trousers.</span> <span class="highlight-three">... he was described as 'imperfectly educated'.</span> <span class="highlight-four">The turf was his true schooling".</span>

<span class="highlight-one">The burglar and safe-cracker Edward Agar was just under 40 at the time of the robbery and had been a professional thief since he was 18.</span> <span class="highlight-two">He returned to the UK in 1853 after ten years spent in Australia and the US.</span> <span class="highlight-three">He had £3,000 in government consol bonds and lived in the fashionable area of Shepherd's Bush, London.</span> <span class="highlight-four">According to Thomas, the robbery "grew almost entirely from the absolute self-confidence and mental ability" of Agar.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">James Burgess was a married, thrifty and respectable man who had worked at the SER since it had started running the Folkestone line in 1843.</span> <span class="highlight-two">He worked for the company as a guard, and was often in charge of the trains that carried the bullion.</span> <span class="highlight-three">As with many railwaymen of the time, Burgess's wages had been reduced as the railway boom had passed.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">Fanny Kay, aged 23 in 1855, was Agar's partner and lived with him at his house, Cambridge Villa, in Shepherd's Bush.</span> <span class="highlight-two">She had previously been an attendant at Tonbridge railway station and had been introduced to Agar by Burgess in 1853.</span> <span class="highlight-three">She had a child with Agar and moved in with him in December 1854.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">William Tester was a well-educated man who wore a monocle and had a desire to improve his position; he was briefly employed after the robbery as a general manager for a Swedish railway company.</span> <span class="highlight-two">He worked in the traffic department at London Bridge station as the assistant to the superintendent, which gave him access to information about the carriage of valuable goods and the guards' rota.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">James Townshend Saward, also known as Jim (or Jem) the Penman, was a barrister and special pleader at the Inner Temple.</span> <span class="highlight-two">His activities were described by contemporary sources as "planning and perfecting schemes of fraud, the bold audacity of which is equalled only by their success".</span> <span class="highlight-three">He was the head of a forgery gang who had been practising cheque fraud for several years.</span>

<span class="highlight-one"><h2>Planning and preparation</h2></span>

<span class="highlight-one">After being dismissed from the SER, Pierce continued to drink in the pubs and beer shops around London Bridge in which railway employees also drank.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Over time he picked up detailed information about the gold shipments to Paris, while he watched and planned.</span> <span class="highlight-three">He concluded that a theft would only be possible if he obtained copies of the keys to the safe.</span> <span class="highlight-four">He relayed his thoughts to Agar before the latter's visit to the US; at the time Agar declined to take part, telling his friend the scheme was impracticable.</span> <span class="highlight-five">When Agar returned to Britain, the two discussed the possibility again and Agar said that "it would be impossible to do it unless an impression of the keys could be procured".</span> <span class="highlight-five">Pierce said he thought he knew how that could be arranged.</span> <span class="highlight-five">They realised that for any theft to succeed, they needed the assistance of a guard travelling in the van with the safes, and an official with access to the staff rotas and who knew when the bullion shipments were to be made.</span> <span class="highlight-five">It was at this stage that Pierce recruited Burgess and Tester to join the group.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">In May 1854 Pierce and Agar travelled to Folkestone to watch the process involved at that end of the line, particularly the location and security surrounding the keys.</span> <span class="highlight-two">They spent so long, and were so obvious, in their surveillance that they came to the notice of the municipal and railway police.</span> <span class="highlight-three">As a result, Pierce returned to London and left Agar to watch alone.</span> <span class="highlight-four">As part of his intelligence gathering, Agar drank in the Rose Inn, a public house near the pier, where railway staff also drank.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The pair concluded that one of the keys was carried by the superintendent of the Folkestone end of the line; the other was locked in a cabinet at the railway offices on Folkestone pier.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">One of the keys held at Folkestone was lost in July 1854 by Captain Mold of the steamship company.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The SER sent the safes back to Chubb for the locks to be reconditioned and new keys issued.</span> <span class="highlight-three">The clerk involved in corresponding with the company was Tester.</span> <span class="highlight-four">By October, Chubb's work had been completed and the keys sent to the SER.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Tester was able to smuggle them out of the office briefly, and met Pierce and Agar in a beer house on Tooley Street, London, where Agar made an impression of them in green wax.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Tester was so nervous when he removed the keys, that he brought two identical ones with him, rather than one for each lock; the plotters were still missing one of the keys.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Agar, using the false name of E. E. Archer, used his own funds to send £200 of gold sovereigns on the SER line.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The box of bullion, labelled "E. R. Archer, care of Mr.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Ledger, or Mr. Chapman", was sent through to Folkestone where Agar would collect it.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Agar collected the package from the SER office and watched while the company's superintendent retrieved the safe key from a cupboard at the back of the room.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Knowing where the keys were stored, the following weekend Agar and Pierce stayed in nearby Dover and walked to Folkestone.</span> <span class="highlight-five">When the boat arrived from Boulogne, both members of the SER staff left the office to meet it; they left the door unlocked when they left.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Pierce entered the office while Agar waited at the door on lookout.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Pierce opened the cupboard and took the safe key to Agar who made a wax impression.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The key was returned, and the two men returned to London via Dover.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">Over the following months Pierce and Agar created rough keys from the impressions they had taken.</span> <span class="highlight-two">In April and May 1855 Agar would travel along the Folkestone route when Burgess was on duty—seven or eight trips in total—and would hone the keys until they worked smoothly and without effort.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Pierce and Agar then separately visited the Shot Tower, Lambeth, where they obtained two long hundredweight (220 lb; 100 kg) of lead shot.</span> <span class="highlight-four">They also obtained courier bags, which could be strapped under a cloak, and carpet bags: these were to carry the lead shot onto the train, and the gold off it.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">By May 1855 the men were now ready to carry out the robbery, and only needed to wait for a day when a gold shipment was taking place.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Tester altered the staff rosters to ensure Burgess was working on the evening mail service for the month to ensure Agar had access to the safe.</span> <span class="highlight-three">A signal was arranged whereby either Agar or Pierce would wait outside London Bridge station every day; if a shipment was being made, Burgess would walk out of the station and wipe his face with a white handkerchief to alert them.</span> <span class="highlight-four">At the same time, Tester would travel to Redhill railway station and await the first stop of the train.</span> <span class="highlight-five">He would take one of the bags of gold and return to London.</span>

<span class="highlight-one"><h2>Robbery: 15 May 1855</h2></span>

<span class="highlight-one">On 15 May 1855, while Agar was waiting outside London Bridge station, Burgess came out of the station, wiped his face with his handkerchief and went back inside.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Agar notified Pierce and the two men purchased first class tickets for the journey to Folkestone.</span> <span class="highlight-three">They gave their bags to Burgess for storage in the guard's van during the journey and, just before the train was due to leave, Pierce took his seat in the cabin, and Agar slipped into the guard's van and hid in the corner, covered by Burgess's overalls.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">As soon as the train departed the station, Agar began work.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Only one of the locks was secured—an SER employee later reported that typically only one lock was used—and Agar soon had the bullion boxes out of the safe.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Instead of opening the box through the front, he used pincers to pull the rivets out of the iron bands that bound the box, and used wedges in the reverse of the box to open the lid without too much visible damage.</span> <span class="highlight-four">He removed gold bars from inside the box from Abell & Co, weighed them with the scales he was carrying in the bag, and put the same weight of lead shot back into the box.</span> <span class="highlight-five">He nailed the bars back around the box, then resealed a wax seal on the front, using a die he had made himself, rather than one of the official seals of the bullion dealers.</span> <span class="highlight-five">He deduced—correctly—that on the poorly lit station at Folkestone, a cursory glance at the seals would not show any change.</span> <span class="highlight-five">He managed to do this before the train arrived at Redhill, which was a 35-minute journey from London Bridge.</span> <span class="highlight-five">When it arrived at Redhill, Agar again hid, while Tester was handed the bag containing some of the gold.</span> <span class="highlight-five">He returned to the SER offices in London, as arranged, so that he could be seen by colleagues and give himself an alibi for later.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Pierce took the opportunity to leave his carriage and join his confederates in the guard's van.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">The other two boxes were examined after the train left Redhill.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The box from Adam Spielmann & Co contained hundreds of American gold eagles worth $10 each; these were weighed and lead shot was again left in their place before the box was resealed.</span> <span class="highlight-three">The final box, from Messrs Bult & Co, contained more gold bars.</span> <span class="highlight-four">These weighed more than the remaining lead they had left and many of the ingots were left behind to ensure there were no major differences in the weights of the boxes when they were later weighed.</span> <span class="highlight-five">When they replaced the bands on the final box, it was damaged, but they repaired it as best they could and replaced it in the safe.</span> <span class="highlight-five">The three men then cleared away the mess they had made—mostly splinters and drops of wax—and prepared themselves by strapping on the courier bags beneath their cloaks.</span> <span class="highlight-five">When the train arrived in Folkestone at about 10:30 pm, Pierce and Agar hid in the van while the safes were removed by staff.</span> <span class="highlight-five">They then left the van and entered the main part of the train, passing through until they reached first class, where they sat until it arrived in Dover.</span> <span class="highlight-five">When the train reached Dover, Pierce and Agar alighted, collected their carpet bags full of gold from the guard's van, then went to a nearby hotel for supper.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Agar threw the keys and tools into the sea before the two men returned to London on the 2:00 am train, which arrived at around 5:00 am.</span> <span class="highlight-five">In total they had stolen 224 pounds (102 kg) of gold, valued at the time at £12,000.</span>

<span class="highlight-one"><h2>Immediate aftermath</h2></span>

<span class="highlight-one">When the steamer carrying the gold arrived in Boulogne, one of the crew saw that the bullion boxes were damaged, but, as staff at Folkestone had not mentioned it, saw no cause for concern.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The boxes were weighed on arrival at Boulogne where the box from Abell was found to be 40 pounds (18 kg) lighter than it had been in London, whereas the other boxes both weighed more.</span> <span class="highlight-three">They were transported to Paris, where they were weighed again, with the same results as at Boulogne.</span> <span class="highlight-four">When they were opened the lead shot was found and the news relayed back to London.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">When the working day began on 16 May, Pierce and Agar went to a money-changer's shop with some of the American eagles and obtained £213 for them; at a second such shop, they exchanged 200 of them to get a cheque for just over £203.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">The three bullion merchants demanded recompense for the lost gold—most of Abell's gold was insured through the SER, but the company denied any culpability, claiming that the robbery must have taken in place in France.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The French authorities pointed out that as the weights of the boxes in France both matched, and differed from that in England, it must have occurred in the UK; both the French and British companies stated "that the crime was an impossibility", according to Thomas.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Newspapers reported that "It is supposed that so well planned a scheme could not have been executed in the rapid passage by railway from London to Folkestone".</span> <span class="highlight-four">Burgess was examined, but not deemed a suspect because of his 14 years of service to the company.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Tester had been seen at the SER offices while the train was still en route to Folkestone, so was also discounted as a potential thief.</span> <span class="highlight-five">A reward of £300 was soon advertised in several newspapers for information regarding the case.</span>

<span class="highlight-one"><h2>Discovery, investigation and arrest</h2></span>

<span class="highlight-one">Pierce and Agar began to melt down the bars to create new, smaller bars of 100 ounces (2.8 kg), although they briefly set fire to the floor of Cambridge Villa when one of the crucibles cracked, spilling molten gold.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Relations between Agar and Kay deteriorated around this time, and he moved out of their house to stay with Pierce while they continued to process and dispose of the bullion.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">£2,500 of bullion was sold to Saward, acting as a fence, and the proceeds split evenly between Agar, Pierce, Tester and Burgess.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Burgess invested his earnings in Turkish bonds, and shares in the brewing company Reid & Co; Pierce opened a betting shop near Covent Garden, telling friends he had won the capital by betting on Saucebox in the St Leger Stakes horse race at long odds.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Tester put his money into Spanish Active bonds.</span> <span class="highlight-four">That September he left the SER and became the general manager of a Swedish railway company.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">At around the time Agar had separated from Kay, he met Emily Campbell, a 19-year-old prostitute, and the two began a relationship; Campbell's pimp, William Humphreys, took umbrage at the loss of her earnings.</span> <span class="highlight-two">To overcome any problems, Agar lent Humphreys £235.</span> <span class="highlight-three">When he went to collect the repaid money, he was arrested as one of Humphreys's associates passed him a bag of coins.</span> <span class="highlight-four">Police stated that this was the proceeds of a cheque fraud in which he was involved and he was charged accordingly; Agar stated he knew nothing of the fraud, and he was trying to collect the money he had lent.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Appearing at the Old Bailey in September 1855 on the charge of "feloniously forging and uttering an order for the payment of 700L [£700], with intend to defraud", Agar was found guilty and sentenced to penal transportation for life.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Awaiting transportation in Pentonville Prison, Agar arranged for his solicitor, Thomas Wontner, to use the £3,000 Agar had in his bank account, and give it to Pierce with instructions that it should be used to support Kay and their child.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Pierce agreed, then reneged around mid-1856.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Desperate for money, she went to see John Weatherhead, the governor of Newgate Prison, and told him that she knew who was involved in the SER bullion robbery.</span> <span class="highlight-five">An investigation was undertaken at Cambridge Villa; police found evidence that corroborated Kay's story, including the burnt floorboards, small specks of gold in the fireplace and under the floorboards, and evidence that the fireplace had been used at a very high temperature.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">Agar was interviewed in October 1856, while still in Pentonville, by John Rees, the company solicitor for the SER; Agar refused to answer any questions, and so Rees returned around two weeks later and tried again.</span> <span class="highlight-two">In the interim, Agar had heard that Pierce had not kept to his word and so, angered by the deceit of his erstwhile partner, he turned Queen's evidence and gave Rees the full details of the crime.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Pierce and Burgess were arrested on 5 November.</span> <span class="highlight-four">As Tester was living in Sweden he could not be arrested, but he was informed that the police wanted to interview him.</span>

<span class="highlight-one"><h2>Legal process</h2></span>

<span class="highlight-one">In November and December 1856 hearings took place at the Mansion House, presided over by the Lord Mayor of London in his role as the Chief Magistrate of the City of London.</span> <span class="highlight-two">For the first two hearings, Agar was not present, but was brought to the court on the third day.</span> <span class="highlight-three">When questioned, he confirmed the story he had given to the police, and identified pieces of evidence that had been gathered.</span> <span class="highlight-four">On 10 December Tester appeared in court, having been dismissed from his position with the Swedish company.</span> <span class="highlight-five">When the Lord Mayor gave his decision on 24 December that the three men were to stand trial for the robbery, Pierce said "I have nothing at all to say.</span> <span class="highlight-five">I reserve my defence."</span> <span class="highlight-five">Burgess and Tester both stated "I am not guilty".</span>

<span class="highlight-one">The trial took place at the Old Bailey between 13 and 15 January 1857, and received wide coverage in newspapers across Britain.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Burgess, Tester and Pierce all pleaded not guilty.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Agar gave evidence against his former colleagues again, and told the court he was, in Thomas's words, "a self-confessed professional criminal who had not made an honest living since the age of eighteen".</span> <span class="highlight-four">Witnesses included the locksmith John Chubb, the bullion dealers, transportation agents, SER staff, the station staff of London Bridge and Folkestone, a customs officer from Boulogne, railway police, taverners and hotel keepers.</span> <span class="highlight-five">All corroborated Agar's story that the four men knew each other, and were present together at various stages of the planning and execution of the crime.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">It took the jury ten minutes to decide on the guilt of the three men, Pierce of larceny, Burgess and Tester of larceny as a servant.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The judge, Sir Samuel Martin, showed what the journalist Fergus Linnane calls "a grudging admiration" for Agar during his summing up:</span>

<span class="highlight-one">    The man Agar is a man who is as bad, I dare say, as bad can be, but that he is a man of most extraordinary ability no person who heard him examined can for a moment deny.</span> <span class="highlight-two">...</span>

<span class="highlight-one">    Something has been said of the romance connected with that man's character, but let those who fancy that there is anything great in it consider his fate.</span> <span class="highlight-two">It is obvious ... that he is a man of extraordinary talent; that he gave to this and, perhaps, to many other robberies, an amount of care and perseverance one-tenth of which devoted to honest pursuits must have raised him to a respectable station in life, and considering the commercial activity of this country during the last twenty years, would probably have enabled him to realise a large fortune.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">Burgess and Tester were both sentenced to penal transportation for 14 years.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Pierce, as he was not a member of SER staff, was given the lighter sentence of two years' hard labour in England, three months of which would be in solitary confinement.</span>

<span class="highlight-one"><h2>Later</h2></span>

<span class="highlight-one">Tester and Burgess were transported on board the Edwin Fox convict ship on 26 August 1858; the destination was the Swan River Colony in Western Australia.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Burgess was given a ticket of leave in December 1859 and a conditional pardon in March 1862.</span> <span class="highlight-three">Tester received his ticket of leave in July 1859 and a conditional pardon in October 1861.</span> <span class="highlight-four">He left Australia in 1863.</span> <span class="highlight-five">Agar remained in England for a little longer; he is known to have been held in Portland Prison in February 1857, before being transported to Australia on 23 September 1857.</span> <span class="highlight-five">He was given his ticket of leave in September 1860, and a conditional pardon in September 1867.</span> <span class="highlight-five">He left Australia to travel to Colombo, in modern-day Sri Lanka in 1869.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">An account of the trial was published in 1857, with illustrations by Percy Cruikshank, the eldest son of Isaac Robert Cruikshank.</span> <span class="highlight-two">The history of the robbery can be found in The First Great Train Robbery, written by David C. Hanrahan in 2011.</span> <span class="highlight-three">In the May 1955 issue of The Railway Magazine the railway historian Michael Robbins wrote an article on the robbery; in November 1980 the Journal of the Railway and Canal Historical Society carried an account written by the historian John Fletcher.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">On 25 December 1960 the television anthology series Armchair Theatre dramatised the crime under the title The Great Gold Bullion Robbery.</span> <span class="highlight-two">Adapted by Malcolm Hulke and Eric Paice from a play by the lawyer Gerald Sparrow, and directed by John Llewellyn Moxey, it starred Colin Blakely as Pierce, James Booth as Agar, Henry McGee as Tester and Leslie Weston as Burgess.</span>

<span class="highlight-one">The writer and director Michael Crichton produced his novel The Great Train Robbery in 1975; his introduction reads "The Great Train Robbery was not only shocking and appalling, but also 'daring', 'audacious' and 'masterful'."</span> <span class="highlight-two">A feature film based on the novel, The First Great Train Robbery (1978), presents a highly fictionalised version of the event, portraying Pierce (played by Sean Connery), as a gentleman master criminal who eventually escapes from the police.</span> <span class="highlight-three">The robbery also featured as one of the themes in the 2006 mystery novel Kept by D. J. Taylor.</span>
